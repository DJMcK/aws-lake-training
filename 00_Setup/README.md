## Create IAM User

In this section we will create a new IAM user with liberal programmatic access to our account. This IAM user will be used by the AWS CLI tools to interact with our account.

* Open the [AWS IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home)
* Go to "Users"
* Click "Add User"
* Enter a unique username (ex. `djm-programmatic`)
![Username example](./assets/username.png "Username")
* Select "Programmatic Access" only
![Access type example](./assets/access-type.png "Access type")
* Click "Next"
* Click "Create Group"
* Create a group with a unique name (ex. `djm-admin-group`) and provide it with the `AdministratorAccess` policy
![Group example](./assets/group.png "Group")
* Proceed with "Next" until you "Create User"
* Download the CSV file

## AWS CLI Configuration

Opening a shell (e.g. command prompt or terminal) run the following:

```bash
aws configure
```

You will be prompted to provide an Access Key and Access Secret - these can be found in the CSV file you downloaded for your IAM user.
