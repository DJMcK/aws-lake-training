# Lake Buckets


## Lake Name

Before deploying anything, first we give our lake a unique name:

```bash
export STACK_NAME="<NAME>"
```

> **Example:** `export STACK_NAME="djm-lake"`

## Deploy: Artifacts Bucket

The artifacts buckets is used to store deployment artifacts (compiled code, cloudformation templates, etc.)

To deploy this bucket, run the following command:

```bash
sam deploy --template-file ./deployment-artifacts.yaml --stack-name $STACK_NAME-deployment-artifacts
```

## Deploy: Lake Buckets

This step will deploy a total of three buckets to AWS. This includes:

* **Raw** - used to store data in a very raw format (binary data, zip archives, etc) with very short time-to-live (TTL) before data is archived using AWS Glacier
* **Landing** - used to store data that may be non-optimal in its storage format or require transformation before becoming useful
* **Curated** - used to store data that has gone through any necessary ETL processes and is accessible for lake users

To deploy the lake buckets, run:

```bash
sam deploy --template-file ./lake-buckets.yaml --stack-name $STACK_NAME
```
